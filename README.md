# Overview

Hey I'm Logan, I really enjoy learning computer programming. My goals are to get a degree in computer science, and eventually develop my own games(as a side hooby).

This code we just made is a kind of a first step into really learning programming in different languages. I already know how to write in C# but there is always more practice you can have, even something as simple as "Hello World!".
What I used for this is Visual Studio Code, I have used other programming writing tools, but so far VS Code is my favorite.
